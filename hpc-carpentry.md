## Repos available from HPC Carpentry

These are repos run by the HPC Carpentry team, which may 
be useful for us, particularly for cluster computing,
but possibly more generally.

- The main [HPC Intro](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro) 
  lesson. Covers basic cluster operations, and a bit of MPI 
  programming.  Of the lessons here, this is likely the 
  most teachable.
- [HPC Chapel](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-chapel).  
  Chapel is a parallel programming language that has many parallel 
  abstractions, and illustrates the principles of parallel 
  programming with a minimum of operational cruft.  The downside 
  is tha the Chapel language is not widely used.
- [HPC Python](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-python). 
  This lesson is about Python data structures and parallelism, 
  and the use of SnakeMake, a combination programming language 
  and workflow tool.
- [HPC Parallel Novice](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-parallel-novice).
  A candidate successor to the HPC Intro lesson above, this 
  lesson covers data-parallel and DASK parallel approaches.
